A script enabling you to download all the videos or the mp3s  of a youtube playlist. 
The script is supposed to run within a Linux terminal, and works perfectly well on the Fedora distro.

Prerequisites: 
NodeJS
youtube-dl (may be found on https://youtube-dl.org/ )


The ytPlaylistDownloader.js script returns to the console a list of the urls and the commands one ought to 
run in order to download the videos of a youtube playlist as .mp4, or their music as .mp3 . 

Once the script runs, the bash fetches the returned strings as commands to be executed. 



INSTRUCTIONS: 
1. Open the terminal in the folder including the scripts. 
2. Run one of the commands below: 

node ytPlaylistDownloader.js   <youtube playlist URL here>  | /bin/bash  (downloads all videos as .mp4) 
node ytPlaylistDownloader.js   <youtube playlist URL here> mp3  | /bin/bash  (downloads the sound of the videos as .mp3) 

If you want to check the command list to be returned from the script, you may run the above commands without the | /bin/bash part. 

The videos/mp3s will be downloaded within the folder where the command was run.


WARNINGS: 
Can be useful with public playlists and public videos only. 
It has never been tested on linux distros other than Fedora. 
Supposed to be used for legal material only.
